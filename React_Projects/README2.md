## About the Project

Outdoors is a React project that serves as an outdoor adventure booking platform. It allows users to explore various outdoor activities, view details, and make bookings seamlessly. The project aims to provide an intuitive and visually appealing interface for adventure enthusiasts. This project was created to enhance my skills in building user-friendly web applications with React, focusing on state management, component design, and responsive layouts.
And its part of my backend‑frontend fullstack project series.
Backend endpoints are hosted separately.
Backend code can be found here: [outdoors-backend](https://tours-app-api-drab.vercel.app/)
