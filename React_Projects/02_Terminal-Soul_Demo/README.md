## About the Project
Terminal‑Soul Demo is a React project where the UI is styled and behaves like a command‑line terminal — think of typing commands, getting responses, navigating via text commands, etc. The idea is to merge the nostalgic “terminal” vibe with modern web UI / React‑powered interactivity.
This project was created to explore interactive UI paradigms, play with React component state & command parsing logic, and to ultimately have a little “experience” rather than just a typical list‑and‑button web app.
